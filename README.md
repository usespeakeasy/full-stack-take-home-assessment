# Speak full-stack take-home project

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in Speak! Weâ€™re excited to have you in our interview process and hope you have a great experience.

This document outlines the details and guidelines for Speakâ€™s full-stack take-home project.

## Project overview

Youâ€™ll build a mini language learning portal: a simple web application where users can browse courses, view lessons, and simulate recording/transcribing speech for a lesson.

- Aim to spend approximately 4â€“6 hours on this exercise
- Use technologies and frameworks you are most comfortable with
- Persist data via a lightweight database or JSON files
- Feel encouraged to leverage AI tooling to efficiently deliver a solution

## Product requirements

### Pages

- A page presenting a list of available courses
- A page presenting the details and lessons for a single course
- A page presenting the details for a single lesson and a _Record_ button

#### Recording experience

- Simulate sending audio chunks to the backend via WebSocket
- Simulate real-time updates to display transcribed text as it streams in

## Provided assets

- [Courses](/assets/course.json)
- [Audio](/assets/audio-chunks.json)
