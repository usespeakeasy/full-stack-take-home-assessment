# Speak full-stack take-home project

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in Speak! Weâ€™re excited to have you in our interview process and hope you have a great experience.

This document outlines the details and guidelines for Speakâ€™s full-stack take-home project.

## Project overview

Youâ€™ll build a mini language learning portal: a simple web application where users can browse courses, view lessons, and simulate recording/transcribing speech for a lesson.

- Aim to spend approximately 4â€“6 hours on this exercise
- Use technologies and frameworks you are most comfortable with
- Persist data via a lightweight database or JSON files
- Feel encouraged to leverage AI tooling to efficiently deliver a solution

## Requirements

### Pages

- A page presenting a list of available courses
- A page presenting the details and lessons for a single course
- A page presenting the details for a single lesson and a _Record_ button

_Note: each page should be designed to support only mobile viewports; they do not need to responsively scale up for wide screens._

#### Recording experience

- Simulate sending audio chunks to the backend via WebSocket
- Simulate real-time updates to display transcribed text as it streams in

<!-- Todo: embed a video or gif of this experience -->

## Provided assets

### Frontend data

- [`audio.json`](/assets/audio.json) contains simulated recorded audio chunks

### Backend data

- [`course.json`](/assets/course.json) contains an enumerable of course entities that exist in the system
- [`transcriptions.json`](/assets/transcriptions.json) contains the corresponding transcribed text for each audio chunk

_Note: Feel free to modify the file type and syntax to align with your chosen technologies._

## Evaluation criteria

- Architecture and code quality
- Code readability and maintainability
- API design
- Real-time communication
- User experience

### Non-goals

Do not feel obligated to invest effort in the following deliverables:

- Automated tests
- User authentication
- Containerization / CI
- Dark mode support

## Onsite presentation

If selected, your take-home project will be a key discussion topic during your onsite interview. Be prepared to discuss:

- Decisions regarding architecture, design, and implementation
- Challenges faced and how you solved them
- Features or improvements you would add with more time
