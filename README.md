# Speak full-stack take-home project

## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in Speak! We‚Äôre excited to have you in our interview process and hope you have a great experience.

This document outlines the details and guidelines for Speak‚Äôs full-stack take-home project.

---

## Project overview

You‚Äôll build a mini language learning portal: a simple web app where users can browse courses, view lessons, and simulate recording/transcribing speech for a lesson.

- Estimated time: 5‚Äì8 hours
- Focus: Clean, well-organized code, solid architecture, and thoughtful trade-offs
- Tech stack: Use any modern frontend (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and backend (Node.js, Python, etc.) frameworks you‚Äôre comfortable with
- Mock data: You may use in-memory data or a lightweight database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, or even JSON files)
- Submission: Fork the public repository (see below) and submit your work as a private fork

---

## What you‚Äôll build

### 1. Course list screen

- Display a list of available language courses
- Each course shows:
  - Course title
  - Instructor name
  - Number of lessons
  - Thumbnail image

### 2. Course detail screen

- When a course is selected, show:
  - Course details (title, instructor, description)
  - List of lessons in the course

### 3. Lesson detail and transcription screen

- When a lesson is selected, show:
  - Lesson title and description
  - ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù button (simulate recording)
  - When ‚ÄúRecord‚Äù is clicked:
    - Simulate sending audio chunks to the backend via WebSocket
    - Display transcribed text as it streams in (simulate real-time updates)
    - You may use provided mock audio and transcription data, or generate your own

---

## Backend requirements

- REST API to serve:
  - List of courses
  - Course details (including lessons)
  - Lesson details
- WebSocket endpoint to:
  - Accept simulated audio chunks (can be simple JSON messages)
  - Respond with ‚Äútranscribed‚Äù text in streaming fashion (simulate with a delay)
- No need for user authentication (unless you want to add as a bonus)

---

## Frontend requirements

- Course list page
- Course detail page
- Lesson detail/transcription page
- Navigation between pages
- Display streaming transcription as it arrives from the backend

---

## Provided assets

- Sample course and lesson data (JSON)
- Sample audio chunk and transcription data (JSON)
- Sample images/icons (optional)
- The public starter repository to fork

---

## Submission guidelines

- Fork the public repository at:
  [https://github.com/speak-app/language-portal-takehome](https://github.com/speak-app/language-portal-takehome)
- Complete your work in your forked repository.
- Make your fork **private**.
- When you are ready to submit:
  - Add the following GitHub users as collaborators to your private fork:
    - tc
    - jerrypopsoff
    - ngamolsky
  - Send the link to your private fork to our recruiter.
- Include a README describing:
  - Architecture and design decisions
  - How to run the app locally
